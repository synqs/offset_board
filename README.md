# offset_board
 A precise offset board used for active magnetic field control.

# Main component: AD524 and AD588 

# FEATURES:

Low drift: 1.5 ppm/°C
Low initial error: 1 mV
Pin programmable output
+10 V, +5 V, ±5 V tracking, −5 V, −10 V
Flexible output force and sense terminals
High impedance ground sense
Compact and easy to assemble
Expensive (good stuff never comes cheap)

# GENERAL DESCRIPTION: 

This board takes in a signal between 0 and 5V which then can be subtracted by a DC voltage provided by AD588 between 0 and 5V set by the poti R2 and then amplified by the AD524. The amplification factor can be set to 10,100 or 1000. 

# SPECIFICATIONS
Typical at 25°C, -12 V to 12 V output, VS = ±15 V, unless otherwise noted.
